The scholarly web is exploding in size and complexity as more research outputs are published online across a plethora of platforms using a diversity of filetypes and formats. According to the International Association of STM Publishers:

>in 2018 there were about 42,500 active peer reviewed journals publishing about 3 million articles a year. The number of articles published each year and the number of journals have both grown steadily for over two centuries, by about 3% and 3.5% per year respectively. However, growth has accelerated to 4% per year for
articles and over 5% for journals in recent years. 
>The reason is the continued growth in research and development expenditure, and the rising number of researchers, which now stands at between 7 and 8 million, depending on definition, although only about 20% of these are repeat authors
>China is now the pre-eminent producer of papers globally (19%) surpassing the US (18%) and around one third of the literature is available legally and freely via Open Access. (https://www.stm-assoc.org/2018_10_04_STM_Report_2018.pdf)



These circumstances mean that, on the scholarly web of data, both people and machines can get confused about author identity and might mistakenly attribute one author's works to another author with a similar name. COnversely, an author whose name changes over time may fail to receive credit for all of his or her works (splitting). An institution such as a publisher, funding agency, or university 
may not be able to validate who is responsible for a work. For all these reasons, 
the scholarly web works better when each of us as researchers has a unique, 
persistent identifier. Just as DOI's pinpoint an exact research contribution, an 
Online Contributor Researcher ID (ORCID iD, pronounced like the lovely flower) 
creates a unique, persistent identifier for an individual researcher.
The illustration below depicts the problems associated with name confusion.

### Exercise 1. Create your own ORCID

Point your web browser to http://orcid.org and follow the directions to register for a new ORCID. Wait for the confirmation email from ORCID to arrive in your email inbox and click on the link it contains to establish your own unique 16-digit Researcher ID -- like a DOI but for people.

If you already have an ORCID but don't remember the number and password, please consult the ORCID help page at <https://support.orcid.org/knowledgebase/articles/895944-how-do-you-check-for-duplicate-orcid-records>. If you end up with two ORCID accounts, you can work with ORCID tech support to merge them per the instructions at <https://orcid.org/blog/2017/03/15/new-feature-alert>.

### Exercise 2. Populate some of the data in your ORCID profile to begin leveraging the benefits of the ORCID.  Add an alternate name in the "also known as" field; compose a brief biography in the "Biography"" field; and add one or more entries into the "Education" and "Employment" sections. 

Refer to the illustration below for an example of Hugh Shanahan's ORCID profile showing data that has been added to basic fields.

Later on in this workshop we will see how data in the ORCID profile can be harvested and used in other trusted Web services you choose to engage with, reducing the need to re-enter information about your professional life over and over.

When you log into your ORCID account, you will land on your profile page <https://orcid.org/my-orcid> with buttons enabling you to add new data or edit existing data.

Welcome to the global scholarly web where, thanks to ORCID:

- You get credit for all your work and contributions 
- No one claims your works as their own
- Publishers, Funders, and Colleagues don't get confused whether a given research work is yours or someone's with a similar or same name!
- You are able to comply with Publisher, Funder, or Institutional mandates that require you to provide an ORCID number in their systems 
    + Publishers that require author ORCIDs are listed at <https://orcid.org/content/requiring-orcid-publication-workflows-open-letter>
    + Funders with ORCID policies are listed at <https://orcid.org/organizations/funders/policies>
    + Institutions that have integrated ORCID are listed at <https://orcid.org/members>
