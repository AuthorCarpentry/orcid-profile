To our loved ones, we are unique in the world, but when it comes to our names on the vast scholarly web, that is not the case! Names are not the best unique identifiers for us as authors because they can be identifical or similar enough that a computer can not tell us apart. Additionally, our names may change over time due to life events; or they may be represented in different ways depending on translation or transliteration. 

These circumstances mean that, on the web of data, we face name confusion challenges. 
We may be associated with work we did not create; someone else may get credit for our 
contributions; or an institution such as a publisher, funding agency, or university 
may not be able to validate who is responsible for a work. For all these reasons, 
the scholarly web works better when each of us as researchers has a unique, 
persistent identifier. Just as DOI's pinpoint an exact research contribution, an 
Online Contributor Researcher ID (ORCID iD, pronounced like the lovely flower) 
creates a unique, persistent identifier for an individual researcher.

Check out these two ORCID profiles: [Carol
Finn](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3144-1645) and [Carol
Finn](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6178-0405)

These two researchers have the same name. Looking at their employment they even work for the same 
agency in the same state!  If not for their unique ORCIDs, these two highly productive 
researchers could be easily confused by both humans and computers.

> ### Exercise 1A. Create your own ORCID
> 
> After watching a demo of the ORCID system and viewing a researcher's ORCID 
> profile, register for your own ORCID using their quick and easy form.
>
> Point your web browser to http://orcid.org and follow the directions to 
> register for a new ORCID. Wait for the confirmation email from ORCID to 
> arrive in your email inbox and click on the link it contains to establish 
> your own unique 16-digit Researcher ID -- like a DOI but for people.

**Welcome to the global scholarly web where you get credit for all your work
and contributions using ORCID; no one claims your works as their own; and
colleagues don't get confused whether a given research work is yours or
someone's with a similar or same name!**
