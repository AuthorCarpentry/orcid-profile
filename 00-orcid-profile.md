#  Getting Started with OrCiD
15 Minutes

## Learning Objectives

* Register for an ORCiD account and activate it (or look up an existing ORCiD)
* Logon to ORCiD and account and populate basic account fields
* Apply desired privacy settings
* Set up a delegate to assist with maintaining account

Citations are a special type of research data that provide a succinct
representation of a scholarly work in a standard format. Citation styles and
syntaxes differ across resource types, subject disciplines and information
systems, but generally have a common kernel of elements:

+ Creator/Author(s)
+ Title of work
+ Publisher of work
+ Publication date
+ Extent/page range
+ Locator (where to retrieve the work)

Additional elements that information providers may also include in their
citation data are subject descriptors, keywords, geographic or chronological
coverage of the work, funder information, copyright and licensing statements,
and so on.

Citation data is critical to research and scholarship because:

1. it permits attribution to works that an author draws on and incorporates
into her own writings
2. it allows the research community to aggregate and integrate the
contributions of all contributors into a useful system for search, retrieval,
tracking, assessment, and reporting.

Citation data is used across the research ecosystem. Citations form the basis
of publication lists on researcher websites; scholarly sharing sites and
repositories; they represent the core of a professional CV; get pasted into a
required section of funder applications and progress reports; and represent
essential data in research information systems such as ORCiD and the DOI
Registry.

An increasing amount of citation data associated with the scholarly record is
being aggregated by the DOI Registration Agencies, particularly CrossRef,
because they require metadata about every digital object being deposited for
DOIs. Their databases are open and accessible at the command line (as we saw in
Lesson 1). Good news!

This lesson introduces an effective and efficient "open science" approach for
creating and maintaining a citations list that can be re-used in
research-related systems such as the ORCiD Profile. It relies on the open
citation format BibTeX to retrieve references from the Web and applies command
line tools to combine citations from multiple sources. By maintaining a
'master' bibliography in a consistent, open, plain text citation format, a
researcher can re-purpose the citation data for reuse in different systems and
services.

> ## Exercise 1A. Create your own ORCiD
>
> After watching a demo of the ORCiD system and viewing a researcher's ORCiD 
> profile, register for your own ORCiD using their quicky and easy form.
>
> > ## Solution 1A
> >
> > Point your web browser to http://orcid.org and follow the directions to 
> > register for a new ORCiD. Wait for the confirmation email from ORCiD to 
> > arrive in your email inbox and click on the link it contains to establish 
> > your own unique 16-digit Researcher ID -- like a DOI but for people.

**Welcome to the global scholarly web where you get credit for all your work
and contributions using ORCiD; no one claims your works as their own; and
colleagues don't get confused whether a given research work is yours or
someone's with a similar or same name!**
