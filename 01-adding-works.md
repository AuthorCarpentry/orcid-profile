## Learning Objectives

* Enter works in your OrCiD profile using multiple approaches
    * Perform a manual entry 
    * Crossref or DataCite wizard
    * Upload a BibTex publications list
* Compare displayed citations from various input approaches and deduplicate records
* Export BibTex citations from OrCiD profile for reuse in other systems 

After creating an ORCiD and validating your e-mail address, you'll have access to your ORCiD profile. You'll notice that ORCiD includes areas for you to enter CV-like material. You can enter as much or as little as you like: depending on your privacy settings, this information is what other people will see when they look up your ORCiD.

Let's discuss the pros and cons of uploading citations from BiBTeX files vs.
relying on the ORCiD wizards.

+ Which one would import grey literature (e.g., dissertations, tech reports)?
+ Which one would import older articles that pre-date the emergence of the DOI
standard?
+ Which one could carry along metadata you prefer not to be included in your
ORCiD profile?
