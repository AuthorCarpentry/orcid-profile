#  Getting Started with OrCiD
15 Minutes

-------------------------

## Learning Objectives

* Enter one work manually
* Enter one work using the Crossref or DataCite wizard
* Enter one work using the Scopus or ResearcherID wizard
* Enter a list of works using the bibtex upload feature
* Compare displayed citations from various input approaches and deduplicate records

----------------------------------------------------

### Exercise 2B. Fetch several references from an open database on the Web and
use them to compose a bibliography for use in a paper

Save each citation in BibTeX format for reuse (e.g., save as cite1.bib,
cite2.bib, etc.)

Concatenate the individual BibTeX citations into one bibliography using command
line tools:

`$cat cite1.bib, cite2.bib, cite3 bib > citations.bib`
`$cat citations.bib`

Everything look okay? Save that concatenated file for use in the LaTeX lesson
Monday night here at Trieste!

### Exercise 2C. Add a citation to your new ORCiD Profile by uploading one of
the BiBTeX files saved in Ex. 2A.

Once done, try ORCiD's own integrated tools for finding and adding citations.

Let's discuss the pros and cons of uploading citations from BiBTeX files vs.
relying on the ORCiD wizards.

+ Which one would import grey literature (e.g., dissertations, tech reports)?
+ Which one would import older articles that pre-date the emergence of the DOI
standard?
+ Which one could carry along metadata you prefer not to be included in your
ORCiD profile?
