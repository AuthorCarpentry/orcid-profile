#  Adding Works

15 Minutes

## Learning Objectives

* Enter one work manually
* Enter one work using the Crossref or DataCite wizard
* Enter one work using the Scopus or ResearcherID wizard
* Enter a list of works using the BibTeX upload feature
* Compare displayed citations from various input approaches and deduplicate records

> ## Exercise 2B. Creating a file of BibTeX citations for use in a paper
> Fetch several references from an open database on the Web and
> use them to compose a bibliography for use in a paper.
>
> > ## Solution 2B
> > Save each citation in BibTeX format for reuse (e.g., save as cite1.bib,
> > cite2.bib, etc.). Concatenate the individual BibTeX citations into one bibliography 
> > using command line tools:
> >
> > `$cat cite1.bib, cite2.bib, cite3 bib > citations.bib`
> > 
> > `$cat citations.bib`
> > 
> > Everything look okay? Save that concatenated file for use in the LaTeX lesson
> > Monday night here at Trieste!

> ## Exercise 2C. Add a citation to your new ORCiD Profile
> Upload one of the BiBTeX files saved in Ex. 2A.
> 
> > ## Solution 2C
> > Once done, try ORCiD's own integrated tools for finding and adding citations.

Let's discuss the pros and cons of uploading citations from BiBTeX files vs.
relying on the ORCiD wizards.

+ Which one would import grey literature (e.g., dissertations, tech reports)?
+ Which one would import older articles that pre-date the emergence of the DOI
standard?
+ Which one could carry along metadata you prefer not to be included in your
ORCiD profile?
