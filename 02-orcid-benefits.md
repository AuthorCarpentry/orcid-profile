#  Benefits of using your ORCID iD

## Learning Objectives

* Integrate your ORCID account with a third party author profile service
 

As ORCID gains status as a global standard identifier for authors, an increasing number of research services integrate with ORCID.  Examples or services that harvest ORCID data and display publication metrics include:

* [ImpactStory](https://profiles.impactstory.org/), a researcher profile system that includes alternative metrics for your research contributions (twitter account required for registation)
* [ScienceOpen](https://www.scienceopen.com/), a researcher profile and open access publishing platform that offers lay summaries of papers, alternative metrics, and more
* [GrowKudos](https://www.growkudos.com/), a research profile system that offers lay summaries of papers, alternative metrics
* [OpenVivo](http://openvivo.org/), a demonstration version of the VIVO profile system that supports contributor roles taxonomy and author networks. The small size and experimental nature of its dataset, however, limit functionality. It offers more of a demontration site than a fully-functional author dashboard. 
* [MySciEnCV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sciencv/), the researcher profile system shared by United States funders
 

### Exercise

For one of the systems listed above, register for a new account using your ORCID.  

Note that data from your ORCID profile is _automagically_ harvested into this new account. Did some of the ORCID not appear? Why or why not?
