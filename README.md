Establishing Scholarly Identity with Online Research Contributor Identifiers (OrCiDs)
=======

Learn about managing your ORCID profile.  If you're reading this on the github
repo, you see the rendered lesson at:

*Content Contributors: Gail Clement, Tom Morrell*

*Lesson Maintainers: Gail Clement, Tom Morrell*

**Lesson status: In Development**

## What you will learn:

* Register for an ORCiD account and activate it (or look up an existing ORCiD)
* Sign in to your ORCiD account and edit your profile by populating basic account fields
* Apply desired privacy settings to the data in your ORCID profile
* Enter works in your OrCiD profile using three different approaches:
    * Enter a DOI and harvest the associated metadata for that work
    * Use the Search & Link tool to find an article to add in the CrossRef (DOI agency) database
    * Upload a BibTex citation to a publication  
* Compare displayed citations from various input approaches and recognize display differents based on different data sources
* Register for an author profile with a third party system (eg, ScienceOpen, ImpactStory, MySciEnCV) with your ORCID number and autopopulate that profile with data in your ORCID account

## Topics:

1. [Your OrCiD Profile](00-orcid-profile.html)
2. [Adding Works](01-adding-works.html)

## Requirements

Author Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
their own computers to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient
workflow.

*Before* working through this lesson you will need: 

* Three citations to your works, including at least two with Digital Object Identifiers issued by CrossRef. 
* For demonstration purposes in this lesson, we are using the Works publicly displayed on [Hugh Shanahan's ORCID profile](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1374-6015) at [https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1374-6015](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1374-6015). Hugh is co-chair of the [CODATA-RDA schools in Research Data Science](http://www.codata.org/working-groups/research-data-science-summer-schools) and loves when students use his ORCiD!

## Tips

If you are not sure that your publication's DOI was issued by the CrossRef DOI Agency, visit the [CrossRef Metadata Search](https://search.crossref.org/) and enter the DOI number starting with the '10'prefix. A record will display if the DOI was issued by CrossRef.
